I am currently an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at [ENSAI](https://ensai.fr/en/)/[CREST](https://crest.science/). In 2024, I worked as a post-doctoral fellow with the [Biomedical Imaging Group](https://bigwww.epfl.ch/) headed by [Michael Unser](https://bigwww.epfl.ch/unser/) at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). From 2020 to 2023, I was a PhD student under the supervision of [Charles Kervrann](https://team.inria.fr/serpico/team-members/charles-kervrann-2/) at the Centre Inria de l’Université de Rennes on the research topic of image denoising. In 2020, I graduated from Grenoble INP – Ensimag with a specialization in mathematical modeling, vision, graphics and simulation. My research interests include statistical and machine learning methods for image processing, inverse problems, optimization and mathematical understanding of neural networks.
