I am currently a postdoctoral researcher with the Biomedical Imaging Group at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), where I am supervised by Michael Unser. From 2020 to 2023, I was a PhD student under the supervision of Charles Kervrann at Centre Inria de l’Université de Rennes on the research topic of image denoising. In 2020, I graduated from Grenoble INP – Ensimag with a specialization in mathematical modeling, vision, graphics and simulation. My research interests include statistical and machine learning methods for image processing, inverse problems, optimization and mathematical understanding of neural networks.
